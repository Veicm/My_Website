                On this page you can find mobile optimized web applications, I wrote mainly for practice but some of them may have also a real usage. 
                So fell free to use them, save them or take a look of the source code.

                    This is a nice little calculator I wrote. It's not very 
                    complicated or efficient but it's awesome. Here is the <a href="https://github/Veicm/calculator/tree/main/mobile">source code</a>.
