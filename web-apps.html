                On this page you can find Web Applications, I wrote mainly for practice but some of them may have also a real usage. 
                So fell free to use them, save them or take a look of the source code.

                    This is a nice little Calculator I wrote. It's not very 
                    complicated or efficient but It's awesome. Here is the <a href="https://github/Veicm/calculator">source code</a>.

                    This is a little game where you can control a rocket and 
                    try to destroy a spaceship. It's not very hard but It's 
                    fun. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/Veicm/rocket-game">source code</a>.
